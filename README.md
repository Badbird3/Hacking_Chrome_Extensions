# Hacking_Chrome_Extensions
I couldn't find much online about pentesting Chromem extensions. Because of this, I have created this post to start the process of creating a Chrome extension hacking methodology. 

## Checklist 
- Threat model: what is the risk in the context of the application?
- Does the extension do anything with network/sensitive cookies?
- How strong is the crypto handling auth tokens?
